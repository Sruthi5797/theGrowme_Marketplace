## 🎨 Customization Guide

// Small for mobile
<Logo size="sm" showText={true} />

// Medium for header (default)
<Logo size="md" showText={true} />

// Large for hero/welcome
<Logo size="lg" showText={true} />
```

### Hide Text (Icon Only):
```tsx
<Logo size="md" showText={false} />
```

### Adjust Animation Speed:
Edit delays in `/components/Logo.tsx`:
```typescript
// Faster animation
const leafDelays = [0.5, 0.8, 1.1, 1.4, 1.7]

// Slower animation
const leafDelays = [2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0]
```

### Change Colors:
Edit fills and strokes in Logo.tsx:
```typescript
// Stem color
stroke="#3b6358"

// Leaf colors
fill="#b9e5b2"
stroke="#61b16d"
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Logo Not Animating:
- Check that Framer Motion is installed: `npm list framer-motion`
- Verify import path: `@/components/Logo`

### Logo Too Large/Small:
- Adjust size prop: "sm" | "md" | "lg"
- Or edit sizes object in Logo.tsx

### Text Not Showing:
- Ensure `showText={true}` prop is passed
- Check that text delay hasn't been removed

### Performance Issues:
- Logo uses GPU-accelerated animations
- Reduce complexity by removing breathing effect if needed
- Consider static version for very old devices
